# bbb-proof-of-concept
bbb-proof-of-concept is a collection of (hopefully) simple bits of code to perform various tasks in bare metal on the BBB/AM335x. This is all gonna be terrible, fair warning... 

Note to me and anyone else who looks at this: Don't, pretty much.

**EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED**

## Special thanks:
- \#beagle on Freenode, for various pearls of wisdom. 
- Matthijs van Duin, for excellent advice and help getting off the ground with bare-metal execution on the BBB. `arch/thumbv7a/asm_common.h` and `arch/thumbv7a/stage0.S` wouldn't be there without him.
